## Lyra Moves List [Under Construction]

This is a reference of lyra/aerial hoop moves I am making for my own personal use. You are welcome to use it, contribute to it, etc. But I am not a personal trainer nor professional acrobat, only an enthusiast, so use at your own risk and discretion.

The moves in this repository are inspired from many classes I have taken throughout my aerial journey and other references (listed below). It is in no way meant to replace aerial classes, but only serve as a reference or guide for myself and others who want to learn more about this circus art, or teachers/students seeking out new inspiration. If the move I post is inspired from a specific post or person and not just widely known moves, I have given a link to the source I was inspired by. If you feel like your signature move / combo has appeared on this page and is not properly attributed or you would like it removed, please contact me or create an issue on github. My intention is to promote this art and not steal from the artists.
